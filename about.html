                    <p>
                        I am V Dhanush Pavan Teja. I am from a small village called Ponnamanda in the Konaseema district of Andhra Pradesh. I did my schooling till grade 12 in Hyderabad. Then I went to Chennai for my degree and graduated with a major in Biological Engineering.<br>
                        <br>My interests (other than teaching) include cricket and movies. I am an avid binge-watcher of cinema, cricket, TV shows, documentaries, anime, etc. (basically anything and everything). I love analyzing cricket and cinema.<br>
                        <br>I joined this fellowship because I have always loved teaching. I grew up surrounded by many of my relatives who were/are teachers. In my first semester of college, I got the chance to teach a 10th grade classroom in a local government school twice a week as part of an NSS project. Since then I wanted to pursue teaching as a profession. Luckily I came across Teach For India during a Pre-Placement Talk session in my college.<br>
